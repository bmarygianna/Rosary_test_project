        <p>"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. <br>
            And therefore also the Holy One which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God." <br>
            Luke 1:35

        <p>
            "Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. <br>
            And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <br>
            For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. <br>
            And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord."<br>
            Luke 1:41-45

        <img src="adoration_of_the_shepherds.jpg">
        <p>
          "And they came with haste; and they found Mary and Joseph, and the infant lying in the manger. <br>
          And seeing, they understood of the word that had been spoken to them concerning this child.<br> 
          And all that heard, wondered; and at those things that were told them by the shepherds. <br>
          But Mary kept all these words, pondering them in her heart. <br>
          And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all the things they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them." 
          Luke 2:16-20

        <p>
            "Behold this child is set for the fall, and for the resurrection of many in Israel, and for a sign which shall be contradicted; <br>
            And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed."
            Luke 2:34-35

        <img src="Jésus_parmi_les_docteurs_Tissot.jpg">
        <p>
            "And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions. <br>
            And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers. <br>
            And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. <br>
            And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father's business?"
            Luke 2:46-49
